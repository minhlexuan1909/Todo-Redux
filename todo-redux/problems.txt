store change but useSelector doesn't update (in TodoThunk.js)
-> immer object (immutable object: like list of objects)
=> return [...state, ...action.payload];
=> return [...action.payload]
=> action.payload.map((item) => state.push(item));

toast doesn't load at start
-> ToastContainer hasn't been load yet
=> Put ToastContainer in App

logout but website doesn't redirect to login page
-> state hasn't been updated
=> state.token = ""

map needs return 
=> use forEach

remove form validation after submit successfully 
=> validated = true -> form will add .was-validated class so after submitting, set validated = false

Button cannot be invoked without new
-> Wrong import because of auto import ("bootstrap" instead of "react-bootstrap")

Deploy routed repo github
=> Use HashRouter with basename instead of BrowserRouter

Anchor links (<a></a>) and Link from react-router don't work the same way and can't use link because of bootstrap
=> Add # at the beginning of URL in href (href = "#/dashboard/profile/change-password") to make <a></a> works like Link without using Link directly
